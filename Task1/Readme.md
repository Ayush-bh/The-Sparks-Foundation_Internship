# Prediction using Supervise Machine Learning

# Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn.

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions.
Also, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied..
