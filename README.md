## About The Sparks Foundation

![](logo_tsf.png)

[The Sparks Foundation](https://thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/) mission is to inspire students, help them innovate, and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind. To inspire, motivate, and encourage students to learn, create, and help build a better society. To teach new ways of thinking, to innovate and solve the problems on their own. We help the students to integrate and help each other, learn from each other, and do well together.

Their Vision Statement : A world of enabled and connected little minds, building future. Our Mission Statement To inspire students, help them innovate and let them integrate to build the next generation humankind.

# TASKS

## Task 2 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning.
    It is regression task, in which we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
    This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. 
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
Problem given - What will be the predicted score of a student,if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs in a day?

## Task 3 - Exploring Unsupervised Machine Learning.
    problem given-From the given 'Iris' dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
    using K means clustring method for the problem given.
    k-means clustering is a method that aims to partition n observations into k clusters, in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the clusters. It is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.
